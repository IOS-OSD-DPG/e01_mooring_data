      Plot showing the depths of CTDs and current meters on the mooring line for each deployment. 
      Each point represents a CTD or current meter. 
      The grey areas denote the coverage of each bin. 
      Bins are centered on the depths 35m, 75m, and 92m with size 10m.

      The data were binned into 10m bins centered on the depths 35m, 75m, and 92m to make these plots. 
      Not all data from station E01 fit into these bins, particularly data from earlier years. 
      Data are separated by instrument (current meter or CTD) and variable (temperature or salinity).
  daily_means:

      Current meter data from before 2007 and CTD data from after 2007 were combined and presented in these plots. 
      The data were binned into 10m bins centred on the depths 35m, 75m, and 95m to make these plots. 
      Daily means were computed for each day that temperature or salinity data were present. SST from cast CTD data is included in the plot for 35m temperature, in black. 
      The cast SST data contain the first observation from each cast and are not averaged. 
      The majority of the cast SST data are from the top 10m of the water column.
